# HangmanOnline

*A project by Fernando Pérez and José Antonio Mota (1ºN)*

An online hangman game for class (1st github project)

HGserver.py is the server program (designed for Ubuntu 22.04 server).

HGClientGUI.py is the client program (designed for Windows, and the one you should download for playing)

The assets folder contains the sound files, the images, and the dictionary that the game uses

The text file "autoevaluacion.txt" contains all the improvements made from the original hangman that was used as a starting point of the project (located in "base")

The folder "calentamiento" contains the files "ahorcadov0.py", "ahorcadov1.py" and "ahorcadov2.py", which are basic hangman versions I had to do before starting the actual project.
